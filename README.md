# A collection of Various Java Programms
------------------
*	01_FindThreeSmallestInArray
<br>Find the 3 smallest elements in an array.
*	02_FindUniqueLinesInFiles
<br>Given a list of files, find all the unique lines that
are contained in all those files.
*	03_SortedMatrixLookUp
<br>Given a matrix[m x n] where every element is smaller than the elements with bigger m or n,
find if a given element exists in the matrix, in Linear Time.
*	04_FindNearestShop
<br>Given N shop coordinates on a 2d plane, find the nearest shop from a man whose coordinates are given.
*	05_RemoveDuplicateLines
<br>Given a text file, remove all duplicate lines.

### Under Construction
*	06_FindPermutationsAtString
<br>A string consists of '0', '1', and '?'. The question mark can be either a '0' or a '1'. Find 
all possible combinations for a string.
*	07_FindLongestSubsequence
<br>Given two integer arrays, find the longest common subsequence. e.g. a = [1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7], b = [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3], return [1, 2, 3] or [5, 6, 7]
*	08_ProgramsTimeSchedule
<br> Write a program to find if a given program can be executed or not. A program's schedule, is 
represented by P1(10, 5), where 10 is the starting time and 5 is the duration. A program can be scheduled,
if it's schedule is not overlapping any other already scheduled programs.
